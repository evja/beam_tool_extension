This is a wide flange beam extension i have been working on for the past month.

It draws any size of wide fange beam to the nearest 1000th of an inch in Sketchup
kind of like the line tool, it draws a steel beam from one input point to another populating it with
holes and direction labels based on the direction (Green axis being North)

Feel free to comment on my code or make any suggestions. it has been a really amazing project for me

I look foreward to creating a few more extensions and will post some of the code here for verson control.
I hadn't been using git for the development of this tool until now beacuse i did it on my work computer(Windows)
and didn't install git on it. bt now the code is sourced from google drive, i do most of the development at
home on my Mac.
